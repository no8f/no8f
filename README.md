### Hello there

Just your average Linux elitist and time waster writing dotfiles.

Below are all the repos I've published (which is none).

âœ¨ But fear not. âœ¨
In the near future I will publish my dotfiles for Arch/Hyprland and some Utils, so this Github account is not a complete waste.

Some facts about me:
- c++/qt dev
- IT Student at DHBW Karlsruhe
